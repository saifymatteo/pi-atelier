## Terminal font

Without a Nerd Font, open `/atelier` → **Settings → Font mode** and select **Plain text**. This replaces session-strip and footer icons with text labels and ordinary separators while preserving colors, metrics, and responsive layout. The change applies immediately and is saved as a global user preference; project settings and display presets cannot override it. Ordinary Unicode borders remain, so a standard monospace font such as macOS Menlo is sufficient.

Alternatively, add `"nerdFont": false` to `~/.pi/agent/pi-atelier.json` and run `/reload`. Atelier does not attempt to detect installed fonts.

The default **Nerd Font** mode requires a Nerd Font selected in your terminal. macOS does not include Nerd Fonts by default. Install one with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font):

```sh
brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
```

Then select **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono** in your terminal's font settings. Installing the font alone does not select it for the terminal. On other platforms, install a font from [Nerd Fonts downloads](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and select it in the same way.

Atelier does not bundle or install fonts or change terminal settings. If icons appear as boxes or missing symbols, select **Plain text** or configure a Nerd Font.

## Sidebar, selection, and images

The sidebar starts visible and hides when the terminal is too narrow. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` to resize it.

Its separate colored, rounded panels use aligned labels and values for model configuration, response timing, Git changes, session storage, usage, and enabled tools. Context usage has a continuous progress track with fractional fill, a right-aligned percentage, and a quieter token count. In short terminals, optional details are removed first; metadata then contracts to retain the core Agent, Activity, and Context panels.

In Pi fullscreen TUI mode, the sidebar is rendered as a separate split-layout child so transcript selection and copy stay scoped to Pi output. Mouse drags starting in the editor or sidebar also exclude sidebar text from screen selection and copy when no modal is open. Regular TUI mode remains terminal-native, so a rectangular terminal selection can still include sidebar text.

Inline images remain visible beside the sidebar. While settings or another capturing overlay is open, visible transcript images temporarily hide to keep the panel readable; closing the panel restores them without changing image data or layout space.

The TODO panel supports Pi `todo` results and the optional `@juicesharp/rpiv-todo` extension.

## Status rail and responsive layout

The composer's top border holds activity, model/thinking, workspace and Git (controlled by the Git segment), and context percentage/capacity in one continuous strip. Violet model text, cyan workspace text, and blue Git text distinguish the groups; context turns amber/red at the configured thresholds. Narrow layouts shorten long names and remove secondary detail before dropping model identity.

The quieter row below shows measured token usage, cache, cost, and response timing. Unmeasured telemetry stays hidden. In Nerd Font mode, [prompt icons](https://starship.rs/presets/nerd-font) identify model, thinking, workspace, Git, input/output, cache, latency, throughput, and context. Plain text mode uses labels such as `git`, `ctx`, `in`, `out`, `TTFT`, and `TPS`. Display presets, visibility, and ordering still apply within each row.

Extension statuses contributed by other Pi extensions render on dedicated status rows beneath the rail row. Each status stays whole and wraps onto a further row when it does not fit, so every status remains displayed; adjacent statuses in a row are separated by the rail's dim separator. A single status wider than the terminal is truncated with an ellipsis. Hiding the statuses segment removes the status rows.

The composer retains its rounded frame, input padding, scroll indicators, and Pi's thinking-level/bash-mode border colors. When a Pi selector replaces the composer, the terminal is below 12 rows tall, or the editor is too narrow for the inset strip, Atelier falls back to the complete status rail below.

Pi supports one custom footer and one custom editor at a time. Extension load order determines which chrome is visible.

## Disabling and re-enabling

Disabling Atelier hides its UI, pauses usage/history scans and streaming estimates, cancels pending workspace refreshes, and aborts active Git inspection. Small run/tool bookkeeping continues. Re-enabling refreshes usage, TODOs, and workspace state once; show the sidebar again with `/atelier sidebar on`. If a response spans a disabled interval, its TTFT/TPS remains unavailable until the next provider request rather than reporting partial timing.
